# NeroBot
Software part of NeroBot 

Technology used 

1. For Designing and CAD tools
  a. For 3D structural design
    --> Software used :- Fusion 360
    --> This will be used to Design the 3D structure of the structure of the jellyfish and part          designing as well

3. For simulation
   a. For motion simulation of robot
   --> Software used :- WeBots
   --> This Software will be used to simulate the motion of the bot and to find any mechanical           obstruction within the bot itself during the motion and make it ready for real world

    b. For Real world Physics
   --> Software used :- Unity Engine
   --> For real world Physics and condition we will use the Unity Game engine where we will     
       train our bot the basic motion and prepare for real world condition without damaging the         bot

   c. For Animation and Visualization
   --> Software Used :- Blender
   --> Blender will be uesd for basic visualisation of the bot moving and record it in different        condition and able to record the movement for any required changes in the model

   4. Embedded System
      a.  Low-Level Embedded Software
      --> Language used :- C/C++
      --> Frameworks :- Arduino Core For ESP32
      --> IDE :- Arduino IDE or PlatformIO

      --> Function :- Servo control
          Library :- Servo.h/ESP32Servo.h
          purpose :- Controls Tentacle movement via Pulse width modulation(PWM)

      --> Function :- Sensor Readings
          Library :- Wire.h/Adafruit_Sensors/Adafruit_MPU6050
          purpose :- An Inertial Measure Unit(IMU), Inter-Integrated Circuit(I2C)
